The solution I've decided to go with is uses as much straght CSS as I could. Unfortunately, until the parent selector (!)
is supported, I had to detect dom nodes with multiple image tags as children and apply a class via javascript.

Everything else is CSS though, and easily degrades to mobile since it's just a scrollable gallery.

I considered using lightboxes and the like, but I like the feel of this. Though more cluttered, I think it has that old
school photo album feel, and I like that.

The height is restricted with viewport units (vw), so as the column shrinks the gallery height does so in proportion. On small screens,
that proportion is increased to match the smaller column witdh.

This means for mobile, you can just scroll the gallery inline without transitioning to another screen or modal.

I'm not sure it's clear that the gallery is scrollable, howver. I'm thinking about adding a slow scroll animation. On laptops, the
scrollbar makes it clear, but on mobile there's no cue. I'm just kinda hoping that an offcenter image will be enough to naturally
get a viewer to scroll.

Also while laptops have multigesture and trackpads, desktops don't have the same thing. That makes this a terrible solution for
desktop users. I know there's less of those now, but still something I'm going to have to sort out.
