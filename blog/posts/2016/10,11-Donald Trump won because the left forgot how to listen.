Something I've always respected about liberal philosophy is how it stems from empathy and understanding. It's where we get the stereotype of the bleeding heart liberal, a supposedly negative stereotype I think many liberals have come to own. Lately, much of the social policy pushed by the left has been based in identity politics which stems from the same ideals. There's some serious problems faced by those at the edges of society who have been marginalized for centuries, and we're finally starting to see mainstream society and media address this. The left has won a cultural victory over the last couple years, and I think this has allowed for some really poor behaviors to be justified in the name of equality.

I used to live a few blocks from the Berkeley campus and happened to be walking by one day during a BLM protest. Some students were locking arms around Sather Gate, a main entry to the campus, blocking students from going to class in order to bring attention to their protest. Being Berkeley, the crowd was mostly white and asian. A black student walked up and tried to pass by but was blocked by the protesters and ended up in a heated exchange by one of the protesters. The black student was mad that he couldn't get to class, the asian girl was trying to explain how this protest was for him and how there were more important issues than getting to class on time, when the black student lost it telling her how he was the first in his family to go to college and how much he worked to get into Berkeley of all schools.

There's radicalism everywhere, but I'm using this as an anecdote to show the general attitude I've seen from those purporting to be for equality while losing sight of the goal for self-satisfaction. Isn't one of the goals of the Black Lives Matter to promote this kind of opportunity for minorities?

## White people problems

It's common knowledge that small town America is struggling. Interestingly, statistics show that the reality is different. For example, [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/upshot/actually-income-in-rural-america-is-growing-too.html) from the New York times uses data from the US Census Bureau showing that the economic status of non-metropolitan America is improving. Even so, there are far fewer economic opportunities in these communities and the same statistics from the Census Bureau do show that the median income for white, rural Americans is below the national median income. There's also the issue of "despair deaths", suicides and opiate overdoses, which appear to be the largest predictor for which districts voted Trump. Between 1999 and 2014 mortality rates in the U.S. rose for white Americans aged 22 and 56, and this includes many of the common leading causes of death such as lung cancer and heart disease. That means not only are middle-aged white people drinking more, using more opioids, and killing themselves at higher rates, more of them are getting sick with the diseases that usually kill older people. And when they do get sick, they don’t get better. Part of this is because of our poor healthcare system, which many people have been quick to point out is something that these same people have been voting against counter to their own interests.

This is precisely the attitude that I'm talking about. The initial reaction when hearing of these problems is a dismissal and criticism of these same people who are facing real problems. And this is the part where I get to the point: valid social capital.

Most of the time, when I hear someone discuss the South, it's immediately derided as some backwater place full of hateful ignorant people. The Confederate Flag has been a point of contention because of the racist baggage it carries. I've been spending alot of time in Virginia, and while that's hardly the deep south, I've met people that proudly fly the rebel flag in the window of their truck or just have it as a bumper sticker. Some were undoubtedly racist, but I've met plenty that really did use it as a sign of southern pride in the same way someone from Chicago or Barcelona flies their regional flag. I'm yet to hear anyone call out someone flying the Cascadia flag for the secessionist movement it represents. Since my entire thesis is about context and nuance, I fell like I need to mention understand that the Cascadia movement isn't that serious and all the negative uses of the confederate flag. But judging someone as racist because they choose to identify with their heritage isn't much different from assuming that the black guy wearing gold chain and low hanging pants is a thug.

Churches have long been the center of communities, especially in small town America. They function as some of the primary social interaction for the town and one of the sources for local welfare. It's not uncommon for churches to be important to the lives of seniors providing social outlets (bingo, bean suppers) and health care support for seniors without family support. But in the same way as southern culture, church has become something to be mocked by many liberals. Again, I'm not supporting the beliefs that homosexuality is a sin, or that evolution is a hoax, but it's another example of valid social capital being pulled away from what can be an incredibly powerful institution.

So, when it comes down to the question "Does the government listen to my point of view?", it's easy to see why many people feel strongly that the answer is no: that only the cities and the elites are the ones with any say, and they have no idea what it's like to live in the country. You could argue that whites have controlled social capital for centuries so it's not that big of a deal that many of them fell left behind, but that forgets that white people are people too and everyone's problems are valid regardless of history.

BLM was particularly bad here. There's absolutely systemic problems from whites oppressing people of color. But it made the discussion around these issues facing rural white Americans hard to talk about, going as far as calling anyone bringing up these issues as racist. I think both the All Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter movements missed the point, that we're better off working to solve our problems together than trying to win the game for our team.

## Hillary: I'm Not Trump!™

During the primaries, there was a large movement supporting both Trump and Sanders, with both being dismissed completely by mainstream Democrats and Hillary supporters. Bernie supporters were naive idealists who didn't understand how politics work, and Trump supporters were ignorant racists. On both counts this reaction refuses to listen to the legitimate concerns from the other side. I saw this all across social media. Bernie and Trump supporters were just as guilty, but I'm pointing this out because the Hillary camp are part of this same group of established, city dwelling elites. It's not very surprising then that so many people would reel away from someone viewed as an insider when they don't think the system is listening. And while Trump is definitely part of the elites with his small loan, his behavior and actions set him apart. Hillary has always had this problem and did little to fix it, instead focusing on Trump's character. I absolutely think that Trump's behavior is unbecoming of the president, but it's not as if Bill Clinton was a shining example of chivalry.

I can't recall a time that I saw a Hillary supporter make a real effort to listen to the critiscms from those that voted for Trump. Many people kept their opinion about Trump secret in fear of backlash. The idea that the reaction to finding out someone supported Trump would be so negative is disappointing. America has it's race issues, but I don't think anyone seriously believes 48% of the country is racist. Almost one third of hispanics voted for Trump. While more hispanics voted for Hillary than Obama, it was a smaller percentage of the overall hispanic population. Hillary failed to overcome her old issues with her image and focused only on Trump's outlandish behavior. I do think there was some sexism at play as well, but by and large I think this was the biggest reason Hillary failed to win. Trump's message resonated and energize people to vote. Hillary didn't,and anecdotally most people I know (myself included) voted for her reluctantly and only as a counter-Trump vote. America rejected her 8 years ago for Obama, yet she was the apparently the strongest the DNC had. The email leaks showing how much they did against Bernie certainly didn't help her image as a corrupt insider.

But largely, I think it was hypocrisy from the left that lost the election. We're quick to point out how an ex-felon deserves a second chance and equally quick to completely ignore someone when they point to the elevated crime rate in black communities as one reason for why they're over represented in police shootings. While the kind of hate coming from the left is far more subtle than what comes from the right, it's still undermining the foundation of liberal philosophy: all people deserve opportunity and dignity regardless of their background.

I hope more people reach out to those that voted Trump instead of continuing all the negativity. Even more I hope we remember this in the next election and can all take the high road, showing why empathy and understanding are important instead of yelling at each other like children. It's what Jesus would have wanted.
