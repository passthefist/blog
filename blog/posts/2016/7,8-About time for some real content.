Looks like we're getting closer to a real post now. Since I need content, I'm gonna do a quick overview of how my half-baked blog system works.

The gist is that I can't be bothered to do anything more than write markdown files. Static site generators like Jekyll are great, and not only
match this problem and probably solve it better, but I've gone and built my own thing for a couple reasons. The code is kinda
sketchy, but not too shabby for about a day's work.

1. I don't want to have to run a script before uploading, I just wanna git push.
2. I want to be able to add things from mobile
3. I'd like to keep this low tech, so I can update posts from my terminal/vim with no fancy web UI.
4. Building things are fun. Honestly, this is pretty much the biggest reason.

This blog is static, similar to something Jekyll would make, but I've set this up to build the pages/posts per-request rather than per-publish.

Posts exist as individual markdown files in the Github Pages repo for this project (there is no master branch, master is gh-pages). Upon visiting the
root page, the browser hits the Github API for a listing of blog post files (just metadata, not content). From this metadata, which gets sorted
in descending date order, the individual markdown files are requested, parsed, and then added to the document.

Scrolling down just loads the next file in the metadata list.

The hackiest part is that the handling of the post date and post title are in the filename. I was hoping to get a commit date for pusblish date,
but couldn't find that in the api. The date is just a comma separated pair of month,day. The post title follows a - after that pair. The literal
filename after that hyphen becomes the post's title.

For example, the title of this markdown file is `7,8-About time for some content.md`. Yeah, spaces don't play well with some
filesysymes, but it's 2016 and easily fixed if it ever becomes a problem.

Though I'd like to improve this whole thing, there are a couple of things I like about this:
* Posts are sorted by date in the filesystem
* It's easy to navigate, since the titles are listed
* Goes along with point 3. A database is easily better, but I can just use standard utilities as my blog interface.

Hopefully I can find a way to read the file's date metadata instead of relying on title munging. I'll have to dig through the API ref and see
what's there.

I'm also curious if I won't eventually be able to show this blog versioned (since it's all in Git) like my own Wayback
Machine.
