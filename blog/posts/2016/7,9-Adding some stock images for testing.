So, if this blog is gonna be at least partially travel related, I'm gonna need a nice way of presenting pictures.

However, I've kinda already backed myself into a corner with the decision to use markdown. Markdown does support arbitrary html,
but I'd like a simpler solution than that.

I'm thinking maybe some more JS hackery, turing series of images one after another into a gallery of sorts. At any rate, I'm adding a
couple stock photos so I'll have something to work with.

While that's kinda unfortunate, I'm digging just writing these posts in Vim or Github's online file editor. My goal is to get some kind of
solution figured out tomorrow. Lisbon is a beautiful city and having to use these stock photos is a bit sad.
