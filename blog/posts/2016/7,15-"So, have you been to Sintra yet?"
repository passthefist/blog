When someone at my hostel finds out I've been here for a couple weeks (and will be for a bit over a month), they
usually ask if I've been to Sintra and if it's worth doing. Sintra is a tourist town about 50 minutes outside of Lisbon,
and used to be part of a Moorish monastary and capital of one of the largest regions in Portugal. There's still a palace
and medival castle, and they're the biggest attractions there. Sintra also has an old city center and is next to Cabo da Roca,
the westernmost point in mainland Europe. The Azores can claim the other two most westly points in Europe, one of which is actually
on the North American plate since the chain of islands straddle the fault between the European and North American plates.
But, being islands and all, that designation is more political (or geological) than geographical, and Cabo da Roca via
Sintra can claim that. And it's somewhere I've been meaning to go, but couldn't find the time or motivation.

A couple hostelmates (Maha, a post-secondary engineering student from Calgary and Rashawn, originally from Arkansa, currently teaching English in
Istanbul and looking to go back to school for Psychology) were talking discussing plans for the day over breakfast, and after Maha
inevitibly asked if I'd heard anything about Sintra. Though I hadn't been, everyone who did had only said good things,
and so we decided to head there for the day. As a bit of an aside, this is why I think remote work is going to
be (and arguably is becoming) more popular, especially with tech workers. Having the freedom for this kind of spontaneaity is a benefit
that's hard to replicate in an office. Unfortunately I didn't charge my phone the night before, so with limited charge there's not many pictures.

Like Lisbon, Sintra is hilly, and it's at the top of these hills where the palace and castle were built. The hill to the medival
castle is steep and nicely defended. Rashawn made a good point about those movies where armies would storm a castle: in this case
it'd be more of a sluggish approach. They'd have to scale a couple thousand meters before facing a castle wall full of archers and
probably worse. Alot of the castles I've seen were similar, but I guess that's why they're still aroud today. Any that would've been
easy to siege probably would have been damaged.

Pena Palace is on an adjacent hill a bit higher than the castle. Supplies were mostly taken by horse back when people lived there, but now a city
bus takes tourists up to see the palace. Though it has seats, the bus is mostly standing room only. There's some incredible views from the
ride up. The bus makes a couple of stops before it gets to the top, the last stop next to the palace. The ticket lines were long, but
we managed to hop in with a couple of guys from Massachusetts. They were Portugese by heratige and flew over after Portugal made it to the
semifinal of the Euros. Not entirely coincidental, since Masachusetts has one of the largest Portugese (and Azorean) populations outside of Portugal.

We parted ways since they chose to take the smaller bus to the palace, an additional 3 euro. It's a bit of a walk from the tourist office, but
really not bad. You also get to walk up along the same path that monastic pilgrims would have taken to the chapel (and later, monastary)
that the palace is built on top of. Tradition says the Virgin Mary made an appearance here, and the chapel was built in her honor.
For centuries Pena was a small, quiet place for meditation, housing a maximum of eighteen monks before eventually becoming the home of Portugese Royals.
From the top, you can see the Atlantic ocean and Cabo da Roca (the easternmost point of mainland Europe).

Unlike some of the dank stone castles in Ireland and the UK, the Moors seem to prefer sandstone as a building material giving their
buildings a brighter feel. Typically, Moorish castles have open courtyards, archways, and extravagent decorative work like muqarnas and
tile mosaics. The palace is similar, brightly painted with plenty of intracate stonework around the large archways. One features a demonic
figure scowling while holding his tree-like horns, perched atop an archway on his fish/mermaid legs. Think original Starbucks logo.
One of the guides said that it's supposed to a newt, representing the creation of the world. Wikipedia agrees with him, so I'm sure it's right,
but I can't find anything on the story and really want to. Google searches just return me to the same sculpture. Other than this, the palace almost looks like
something from a Disney park. The outer walls are painted bright primary colors, and the parapets are large and blocky as if made for a child's toy.

Inside, the main living area is in a two floored square around a small, tiled courtyard. Multiple royals made changes over time, installing
'modern' luxuries like a bathroom with a British style toilet. The tour goes in reverse from how visitors would have entered, starting with
the most private rooms, the bedrooms, through various studies, a tea room, a smoking room, and then finally the sitting area. I think they deliberatly
set up their entry way to intimidate visitors and remind them of the power and wealth of the royal family. It's a striking structure in it's own right,
and after making your way up the hill through the Queen's garden, full of beautifly rare and exotic plants, you'd wait in what was one of the more elegant
rooms in the palace. At the time, they actually kept much of the paintings and engraved/painted plates in this room. Originally paneled in a dark wood
with gold leaf trim, it was later painted white after the last Queen fled in exile in 1910, the gold likely stripped by the servants of the palace.

There's much more to see, and I'll definitely be back. At the very least I'd like to get a 360 panorama in Cabo da Roca of the ocean and the mainland.
I think the real highlight though is how this went from just some breakfast smalltalk into what ended up being a pretty nice day. Something
I've come to love about travelers and hostel living is how friendly and open everyone is. I've been of the opinion for a long time that most people are
more likely to help others than harm them, and this has only gotten stronger meeting more strangers.
